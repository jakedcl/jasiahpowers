      "I created and conceptualized this project due to the heavy cultural significance the polo brand has had on me and those around me, being a NYC native, Brooklyn especially, we all understand how much of a staple Polo is. Whether that's black relativity or NYC culture, If you reside anywhere we do, you understand the power a good Lo piece holds. A majority of us been draped in some good Lo whether it's now or as babies but its significance can never be questioned. So I did this project to bring together a group of people to not only formulate new connections, create a new experience and create sum beautiful content, but to highlight a communal staple that we all have been in close proximity to.",

      "A project I put together to essentially bring together a group of beautiful fly black people to highlight a brand with heavy cultural relevance, that brand being @telfarglobal! I personally felt like Telfar embodies black luxury and it's grown itself into a cultural staple and I wanted to highlight that through this visual experience. Black joy and fly garments is a combination that will never fail! So I hope y'all enjoy this body of work! Thank you to everyone that helped out with this project, I couldn't have done this without v'all. And thank you to @swavie for helping me shoot this and make this possible, I couldn't have executed this without a expertise! ",

    bio: "Brief description of proj4",
    description:
      "The Northface jacket has been a staple in New York culture since our elders were stepping out in the flyest way fit. And that sentiment holds true now as the youth still uphold that powerful notion. The kids of today carry the power the north face has by mixing and matching it with the newest pieces and flyest garments to date. The Northface jacket, as shown in many different silhouettes, is a piece that instills a sense of comfort and confidence in the young kids of New York today, and by that same sentiment I devoted this project to highlighting the beauty in that. So I rounded up as many people that own north faces to make a piece of visual art centered around the infamous Northface jackets and pieces alike. Thank you to every soul that showed and everyone that assisted!",

      "I was honored and blessed with the opportunity to curate a project for @planes And with this piece I wanted to showcase the beauty of young energy whilst staying true to my roots and what my foundation entails, a big piece of that being the fact that I'm from New York and the culture behind that, from the uniform to the city bikes to the natural swag we have when we dance, vibe ,talk, or simply make our presence known! I wanted to capture motion and energy with this one and I think it was fulfilled (PS, Peep that last slide for a montage vid with all the dance clips) I wanna say a huge thank you to Paper Planes/Roc Nation for giving me the opportunity to curate a project utilizing your Pieces, it was an experience I'll never forget for I'm happy to be considered to begin with. And thank you to my team and everyone",

      "I was given the opportunity to document the Labor Day parade in collaboration with @woodstackny & @nike. this was a beautiful opportunity as I used to watch the Labor Day parade as a kid when i used to live in crown heights, this project was an enlightening experience as it brought me back to my roots, the embodiment of a full circle moment if you will. Going from watching the parade as a kid to documenting it from my perspective showed me the beauty in creation and the power in believing in your abilities through and through. More than appreciative for the opportunity, hope yall enjoy !",
